        <h1>A Brief Introduction to ‘Suicide Squad’</h1>
        <img src="poster.jpg" alt="poster">
        <p>
          The title “Suicide Squad” has been featured in DC Comics since the late 1950s, but it’s hardly been a household name — until now.
        </p>  
        <p>
          This August, after two years of hype and buzz, Warner Bros. ensemble action movie “Suicide Squad” will hit big screens. The film, directed and written by David Ayer (“Fury”) is essentially “The Dirty Dozen,” only with comic-book characters: The government rounds up a bunch of incarcerated bad guys to perform a deadly mission.

          While the cast is full of recognizable faces and names — Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jared Leto, etc. — most of the characters, outside Leto’s Joker, aren’t as notable as fellow DC stalwarts Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. Get to know the squad better here, with this quick guide to its members and origins.

        <p><b>Task Force X</b></p>
        <p>
          That’s the official name for the group of dangerous criminals who are coerced into doing the U.S. government’s dirty work. The first such group, however, was a team of soldiers and scientists dispatched to tackle top-secret missions. The first “Suicide Squad” appearance came in #25 of the “Brave and the Bold“ comic book, dated September 1959. It was during the 1986 “Legends” crossover event, however, when Task Force X became a team of supervillains under the government’s supervision. Suicide Squad is an apt nickname for the group, which has had various members through the years. Often, their missions are seemingly impossible, and if they ever try to escape, government operatives detonate bombs affixed to or implanted in the bad guys.
